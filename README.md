# Analise_Musical
# first commit  
This is a musical analysis made in Python that use the API Spotify to collect the musics.  
Charts were plotted to know what define a music genre.  
It was noticed that musics like pagode have a high valence and rock music have a high energy.  
Then was made clusters through the machine learning algorithm KMeans to grouping the musics by genres.  
# second commit  
Now the algorithm identify 4 distinct music genres
# third commit  
I write an article to explain about what is the project and show the results found.
